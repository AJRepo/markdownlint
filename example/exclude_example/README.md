# Example of a custom .mdlrc and style sheet

This directory has a sample .mdlrc file and the style sheet it calls.

This would be used, for example, in a repository with CI checks that include checking .md
files where you would have the style sheet and .mdlrc in the same directory as your code.

It will exclude a very long line like this one that would ordinarily be flagged by mdl as a violation.
